title: Writing source code for developers
---

Source code is written for the interpreter, but it is also written for:

* That is for you(the developer) to be able to look at what you've done, and understand what your program is intending to do.
* Other developers, people on your team. 
* Your future self. If you come back 6 months later and looking at the program. 

### Key take home points: 

Write code, that it not only does the right thing. But also makes sense. 

Try to strive to write everything in such a way that your future self having no context having completely forgotten having had many nights of sleep since. can look at a line of code, and understand what it meant. what was it intending to do, what was its pros and cons. 

Conclusion, Its incredibly important to write source code, from the perspective of the developer, more so of the perspective of the program.
